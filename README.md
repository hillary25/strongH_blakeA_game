# Starship Troopers Tie-In Game
This is an HTML5 game using JS as the engine to celebrate the 20th anniversary release of Starship Troopers! Our game can be played by all ages.

<b>What is the memory game?</b></br>
This is a game built to test the players memory. The player tries to match the icons in the deck of cards. Match all the icons and you win!

Starship Troopers version: Using the ships control board, match all the icon pairs to guide the Rodger Young through battle! Red cards mean no match, green cards mean you found a match. Score should reach 16.

<b>Instructions</b>
1. Click on a card
2. Click on another card and try to match icons.
3. Match cards properly and the card turns green. This means you are steering the Rodger Young properly. The score will then increase by 2. If you do not find a match, both cards flip back over and the colour stays red. This means the ship is steering off course. Make sure to change all cards to green as the control board needs to be all green to win!
